# High-Precision-Impulse-Response-Matrix-Generator-Based-on-the-Golden-Ratio-
This repository hosts a Python generator for ultra-high-precision Impulse Response (IR) matrices. It is designed for stereo field manipulation and high-end audio transducer emulation, using arbitrary-precision arithmetic to ensure mathematical purity and verifiable results.
